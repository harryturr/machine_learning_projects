# project 1

## description
In this project, we implement two linear classification techniques -- logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

The goal was to gain experience implementing the algorithms from scratch, and to understand and compare their performance.

## code
* utils.py 
    * holds all of our classes and functions
* finalscript.py 
    * runs the analysis using log. reg. and LDA on our two different data sets
* .ipynb
    * shows some data set exploration and explains considerations we made in cleaning our data

## to run
simply run 

    python3 finalscript.py

in your favorite terminal emulator.
